Calculate_Regression
====================


1. STEP 1
Calculate regression coefficient.
The regression coefficient indicates how well linear regression fits to the original data.

2. STEP 2
The program removes some data numbers if the coefficient regression get worst, with these numbers.

Then, you obtain "clean data", without points that generate the bad coefficient.
